backbone-pig-game
=================

This is a javascript implementation of the dice game pig---a dice game that can be played with 2 or more people.  Each turn, you will roll the dice, and whatever you roll will be added to your total score.  You may choose to roll the dice as many times as you wish... But watch out!  If you roll a one, you will forfeit all of the points you earned during your turn, and the computer will take its turn.  First one to get 50 points wins!

For more on this game see ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)"] (wikipedia's article).  This app uses a variation on the 2-die rules.

The app is programmed using Backbone with modular design such that it will be easy to extend to take input from the user on changing the number of players, what type of players (computer or human), winning score, how many dice, etc.

To run the app locally, all you need to do is download the source files and open up index.html in your browser.  Or, to play online, go to [http://evasnow.github.io/backbone-pig-game/] (the website).
